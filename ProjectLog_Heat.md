# Project Log: Argentine Basin Lagrangian who knows

### May 22nd: 
Definitely not going to be a budget. Talley says if we were going to do a budget, we would have started with the whole ARGO set. There is a possibility the quesiton I'm looking into is how mesoscale processes affect the carbon uptake in the region. Talley mentioned that I could use the udnerway pC02 taken by the A17 route cruises (WOCE Atlas? or AMT28? most likely AMT28). She also mentioned that Matt will have air-sea fluxes I can use to compare to what I have going, but they will not be a 100% match because I won't be closing a budget. I will have to include in the narrative why the floats I'm using were put where they were put, so that will be a sitdown conversation with Talley about why she chose them. 

DONE: Add a bathymetry map with trajectories

DONE: Add Heat Flux maps with trajectories 

!! Add Fresh Water Flux maps with trajectories 

!! Do basic scatter plots of all the properties shown by raw ARGO data - BEFORE and AFTER interpolation

!! Do waterfall plots

Currently the 12881 float skipped the vehma channel, which is a pathway for Antarctic Bottom Water. It also missed the Rio Grande rise, which is what we wanted. 

The Argentine Basin is a really active area where a lot of mesoscale processes are happening. There is a big area of cooling, as shown by the AMT28 Heat Flux. This is because the Brazil current moves south, and therefore cools off. 

These specific floats (their "stories") tell us about the processes there. 

Q:  She mentioned there suddenly being warm water for the same salinity at the bottom. What is the significance?


The long portion of my CT/AS plot is the subtropical gyre thermocline, and then when it turns the corner its getting into antarctic intermediate water, then into antarctic deep water. 

It can sustain a temperature minimum because there is that change in salinity. 

Always find a way to show where the data was collected if you are doing interpolation, and include narratives for each plot so you have context for the data after looking at them solidly.
